    "**Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "UC Berkeley Delta Sigma's elections follow the rank choice voting method. This method, which is currently being used for San Francisco's elections, has voters rank all candidates running and uses a process of elimination until one candidate receives majority votes. If no majority is reached the Delta Sigma officer position will remain unslated. Later, there will be a follow up election process to fill all unslated positions. Rank choice allows every Delta Sigma member's voice to be heard equally. Each voter ranks the individual positions based on who they believe would excel the most. The algorithm you see below takes in these votes and every candidates preferences to calculate an unbiased slate that represents the wholistic view of Delta Sigma. The slate calculated is not final and will be presented to the entire chapter to receive a final vote for approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Read each step of the algorithm to understand how it works\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Replace the two csv file names for the Board and Operating Comittee votes (in **Step 1**)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) At the top of your screen click 'Cell'\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Click 'Run All'\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Scroll down to the bottom to see the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Besides Step 1 you won't need to type anything else.**\n",
    "In addition to the desciptions for each step, there are comments integrated throughout the code that further explain the process. At the bottom of the algorithm you will see two different slates: 1) a slate containing any double slates and 2) the final proposed slate that accounts for preferences and will have no double slates. \n"
